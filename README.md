# Noctishop

Noctishop is an almost fully featured e-commerce website that supports authentication, payments via paypal, products, users and orders management through a dedicated UI for admins.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 16.0 installed

### Setting up the environment

Rename the `env.example` to `.env` and assign each variable to your corresponding keys.

The default values for certain variables are already assigned (tax and host), give them a new value just when necessary.

npm install
```

or (if you're using yarn):

```
yarn
